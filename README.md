Disable Stupid WordPress Admin Email Check

As of WordPress 5.3, every 6 months any admin logging into the back end will be prompted to confirm the correct admin email.
Particularly with a multi-site install, this is an annoying nag screen and pointless.
Install and activate this plugin to disable this nag screen that should never have been put into WordPress core. And enjoy!
